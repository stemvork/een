# Maintain The Stations

[Lockdown Productivity: Spaceship You (CGP Grey)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snAhsXyO3Ck)

# Mission: return better than you left.

> Your home is now a vessel. Darkness and disorder await. There are things to do.

# Core generator
The core generator represents physical and mental health. The passive forces of the universe slow that which is active. Accelerating one core aspect accelerates the other. Prime with the physical! Brains usually can't think themselves better, when dangerously apathetic or overactive. Physical activity brings the brains back to baseline.

# Separation of concerns
Four vital stations: exercise, sleep, entertainment, creation.

## Exercise station
> Need to spend a minimum amount of time.

Needs to be empty. Exercises are in the communicator (device). Exercise is non-optional. This helps you return better than before.

## Sleep station
> Needs constistent schedule (amount and timing).

Respect (sanctify!) the sleep station: sleep only. When not able to sleep, get up and come back later. Consistent waking times matter.
There are a lot more hours in the day than sleep and exercise! 

The stream looks infinite, but it isn't. Not everything is worth watching. Games can easily eat into the hours and hide the state of the core. Lapses into lethargy are coming... As are anxiety attacks from news sources.
## Entertainment station
> Needs a maximum amount of time.

> Needs a minimum quality of time.

Take action from couch, sanctify it! Only use the couch for actually ENJOYABLE content and activities.

## Creation station
> Will be used for the remaining time.

Work, study and practice. Again, return better than you left. Think of crafts, coding and cooking. Keep the station hygienic. Only create, don't sleep or chill here. Also don't eat here! Take a break, return when ready.

## Positive or constructive mindset
> Maintain the stations and the stations will maintain you.

There is no point in berating yourself. Just. Keep. The. Core. Spinning. Complete the mission. Return better than before.
